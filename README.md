# 👋 Hi, I’m **Haike Yu (Henry)**  
**M.S. Computer Science (Machine Learning Specialization)** @ *Georgia Tech (OMSCS)*  
**B.Sc. Computer Science & Mathematics** @ *University of Toronto*

I’m a **Machine Learning practitioner** interested in how data-driven systems model  
**human language, emotion, and behavior**.

My long-term goal is to work at the intersection of **Machine Learning and Psychology**.  
At this stage, I’m in a **cultivation phase** — open to **applied ML and research roles**  
that help me strengthen both **industrial execution** and **research intuition**.

## 🧠 Interests
- ML systems related to mental health, emotion, and behavioral signals  
- IFS-style part modeling, internal states, and representation of psychological constructs  
- PHQ-style assessment modeling and mental health signal extraction from language and speech  
- Speech & language modeling (ASR, diarization, representation learning)  
- Deep learning in practice: accuracy–latency–stability trade-offs under real-world constraints  
- Bridging abstract psychological concepts with concrete, testable ML experiments

## 💼 Experience

### 🎙️ Machine Learning Intern — [Vosyn Inc.](https://vosyn.com) *(May 2025 – Dec 2025, Remote · Toronto, ON, CA)*
- Integrated **WhisperX + NeMo + FasterWhisper** into a GCP-based speech pipeline for speaker diarization and transcription.  
- Improved **Word Diarization Error Rate (WDER)** stability by 25% through hybrid timestamp alignment.  
- Built an internal evaluation platform for large-scale audio benchmarking (WER, cpWER, WDER).  
- Refactored modules to balance GPU memory, inference latency, and pipeline reliability.  
- Mentored new members on debugging and deployment workflows in a fast-paced startup environment.

### 🏦 Data Analyst Intern — People’s Bank of China *(Jul 2023 – Aug 2023, In-Person, Guiyang, Guizhou, CN)*
- Reclassified loan categories via **Oracle SQL**, improving high-risk loan identification by 13%.  
- Built APIs to streamline analytics workflows, enhancing cross-department data access efficiency.  
- Experimented with **Neo4j** graph structures to support scalable machine-learning integration.

### 🧭 Data Processing Intern — Bank of Guiyang *(May 2023 – Jun 2023, Guiyang, Guizhou CN)*
- Developed a **web scraper (Python + Scrapy)** that extracted 100K+ job postings for workforce analysis.  
- Built a complete data-cleaning and processing pipeline, filtering 1K+ relevant samples.  
- Deployed the structured dataset via **Flask on Alibaba Cloud** for real-time internal analytics.

## 🎯 How I Think About My Path
I’m aware that growth often comes with discomfort, uncertainty, and detours.

This path hasn’t always been smooth, but it’s one I chose deliberately — guided by curiosity and sustained by genuine interest rather than external pressure.

What keeps me moving forward isn’t the absence of difficulty, but the presence of something I care deeply about.  
Holding onto that has taught me patience, resilience, and a quieter kind of persistence.

## 🧩 Fun Facts
- I love exploring how people express emotion through language —  
  and how models can learn to understand it.  
- Outside of ML, I enjoy skiing, gaming, and learning how things work from first principles.
