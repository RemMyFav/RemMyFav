# 👋 Hi, I’m **Haike Yu (Henry)**  
**M.S. Computer Science (Machine Learning Specialization)** @ *Georgia Tech (OMSCS)*  
**B.Sc. Computer Science & Mathematics** @ *University of Toronto*  

I’m passionate about exploring the intersection of **Machine Learning and Psychology**,  
and how data-driven systems can help us understand human emotion, language, and cognition.  
Currently, I’m working on applied **Deep Learning** and **Speech Processing** projects,  
and continually refining both my research intuition and hands-on engineering ability.

## 🧠 Interests
Over time, I’ve become deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and psychology — particularly how the two fields can work together to help us better understand mental health, emotion, and human cognition.

## 💼 Experience

### 🎙️ Machine Learning Intern — [Vosyn Inc.](https://vosyn.com) *(May 2025 – Present, Remote · Toronto, ON)*
- Integrated **WhisperX + NeMo + FasterWhisper** into a GCP-based speech pipeline for speaker diarization and transcription.  
- Improved **Word Diarization Error Rate (WDER)** stability by 25% through hybrid timestamp alignment.  
- Built an internal evaluation platform for large-scale audio benchmarking (WER, cpWER, WDER).  
- Refactored modules to balance GPU memory, inference latency, and pipeline reliability.  
- Mentored new members on debugging and deployment workflows in a fast-paced startup environment.

## 🧩 Fun Facts
- I love exploring how people express emotion through language —  
  and how models can learn to understand it.  
- Outside of ML, I enjoy skiing, gaming, and learning how things work from first principles.
